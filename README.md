## Development

1. Clone this repository and open it in terminal
2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   > Note: if you are seeing the following error when building the app:
   >
   > > An index signature parameter type must be either `string` or `number` in
   > > `./node_modules/@types/babel__traverse/index.d.ts`
   >
   > [The workaround requires manually editing the type in node_modules](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/65766#issuecomment-1596187449)

3. Start the app in development:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   or do a production build:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
